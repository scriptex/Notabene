# Notabene

Notes, Reminders and Todos App for Android and iOS

## Dev details

This application is built with Ionic 1 using AngularJS 1.6.

**As you may have noticed, it is pretty old and outdated.**

It was built as an exercise and turned out to work pretty well.

A recode in modern ES2017 is planned which will also introduce a new framework (probably React, but Vue is also being considered).

## About

The application allows you to login with email or with facebook/twitter/github.

Then you can add notes, todos and reminders.

Reminders trigger push notifications and can be set to repeat in different periods.
